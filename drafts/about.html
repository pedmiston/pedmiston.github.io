         My needle in this haystack is how language gets its meaning, in particular what it means to know the name of something. This may seem an esoteric question, yet I firmly believe that understanding pieces of language in chunks small enough to hold in my hand can give us insight into the system as a whole. For example, in my masters work I studied the fine-grained differences between the verbal name of a category of objects, such as the word "dog", and a familiar, nonverbal sound also characteristic of those objects, such as a dog bark. I found that language, but not these nonverbal cues, can be thought of as a cue to the whole category of dogs; in a way, linguistic cues activate abstract knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
         Demonstrating "abstractness" is an obtruse exercise, but I did it by demonstrating that people have a really hard time "abstracting" from nonverbal cues. For example, participants in my studies were faster to recognize a picture as a dog if that dog resembled the most likely source of the bark: if it was the right size and presented at the same time as the bark. Of course, people can perform comparably whether asked to identify a dog following the word or the sound of a dog's bark, but the systematic differences between the ways in which verbal and nonverbal cues facilitate this task suggest that the two cues are activating different types of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
         The fascinating result is that language, by being unmotivated to refer to a particular source, is actually a better cue for identifying all dogs. In this way, category labels help us carve the world at it's joints by focusing our attention on only those dimensions that matter for the task at hand.
        </p>
        <p>
         My other interest in psychology is also a situation where carving is happening: the carving of visual input into meaningful behavior. Psychology is social by default, and my interest is the stage onto which all kinds of human interactions play out. The function of that stage is to provide our cognitive systems leverage for interpreting the movements and noises of the things around us as behavior: as purposeful action that can be guided by "invisible" mental states, desires, beliefs, and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
         Psychologists have studied this foundational ability for many years, yet I fear we have passed over the very utility of understanding the minds of those around us by searching desparately for a mind-reading "switch" in the human brain. The utility of mind reading is to make sense of an agents future behavior. In the same way that language can be thought to focus attention only on the features of category members that matter for categorization, mind reading can be thought to narrow the range of behaviors that an agent will likely take.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mind reading is the brain making predictions, much the same way as 3-D vision is the brain making predictions, the only (ha!) difference between mind reading and vision being that mind reading invokes not a physical cause for the way arrays of light are structured by matter but a mental cause for the way behavior is selected by an agent.
        </p>
        <p>
         I dream of combining these two research passions into socio-linguistics, which could be thought of as the way we use language to help us understand human behavior at an incredible speed and depth of processing.

> In the domain of symbols, you might be able to express a quality like "redness." In postsymbolic communication, you might come across a red bucket. Pull it over your head, and you discover that it is cavernous on the inside. Floating in there is every red thing: there are umbrellas, apples, rubies, and droplets of blood.

It is a new kind of concreteness that is as expressive as an abstract category.

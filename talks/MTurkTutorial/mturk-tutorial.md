### 

1. **HIT** (Human Intelligence Task)
2. **Requester** (the Researcher)
3. **Worker** (the Participants)

> Before the Internet, it would be really difficult to find someone, sit them down for ten minutes and get them to work for you, and then fire them after those ten minutes. But with technology, you can actually find them, pay them the tiny amount of money, and then get rid of them when you donâ€™t need them anymore.

## Method 2

### Catch Questions

## Method 3

### Full Verification

* Random codes are generated per subject.
* Codes are saved to be verified later.
* Probably overkill.

Attempted to replicate:

* Reaction time experiments (flanker, stroop)
* Rapid stimulus presentation (attentional blink, masked priming)
* Learning studies (category learning)
